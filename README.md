# Global Game Jam 2018

This is our game submission for the Global Game Jam 2018, created around the topic 'Transmission'.

### Brief summary

TCP is a puzzle game where you play as a sentient robot, transferring your conscience to different devices in order to make your way to the exit.

You can download the original version, ready to play, from [here](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/tcp).
